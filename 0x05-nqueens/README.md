Objective:
The objective of the 'queen' function is to solve the N Queens Challenge, which consists of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.

Inputs:
- sys.argv[1]: integer N, representing the size of the chessboard.

Flow:
1. Check if the function is being called as the main program and if the input is valid.
2. Iterate through the rows and columns of the chessboard, checking if the current position is safe to place a queen.
3. If a safe position is found, place the queen and continue to the next row. If the last row is reached, append the solution and reset to the last unfinished row and last safe column in that row.
4. If a safe position is not found, go back to the previous row and continue from the last safe column + 1.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until all solutions are found or it is impossible to place any more queens.

Outputs:
- solutions: a list of lists, where each inner list represents a solution to the N Queens Challenge. Each inner list contains the coordinates of the queens in the format [row, column].

Additional aspects:
- The function checks for invalid inputs and prints error messages accordingly.
- The function uses a backtracking algorithm to efficiently find all solutions to the N Queens Challenge.
